The plots of charge transfer couplings distribution are deposited.  


The large-scale quantitative assessment of charge transfer preference in protein complexes 
by calculating the charge transfer couplings in all 400 possible amino acid side chain combinations, 
which are extracted from available high-quality structures of thousands of protein complexes. 

The database of amino acid fragments is also given, which is a snapshot of the "Atlas of Protein Side-chain Interactions" at 2017-06-01.
One may obtain the database from http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/sidechains/ or directly contact with owner of the database.


The charge transfer couplings are calculated following the previous work of Liu and co-workers.
