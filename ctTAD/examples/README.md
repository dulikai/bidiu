The data for deriving the charge transfer topology associted domain are deposited for a few specific proteins.  


the graph theory is employed to provide an alternative solution to distinguish 
the significant charge transfer regions between the core active site and the surrounding protein environment in the QM/MM simulations. 

According to community detection algorithm for complex network, the charge transfer topology associated domain (ctTAD) 
provides a general tool for systematically minimizing the charge transfer effects of QM/MM boundary within a few minutes.


The charge transfer couplings are derived from bioTB. https://github.com/dulikai/bioX
